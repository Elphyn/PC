    Set the size of vectors to 1000
    Create two random vectors named vec1 and vec2
    Create shared memory for the vectors named vec1_shared and vec2_shared
    Copy the vectors to the shared memory using np.ndarray() and the buffer attribute
    Define a function named parallel_dot_product which takes start, end, shared_mem1, shared_mem2, output, and lock as arguments
    Reconstruct the numpy arrays from the shared memory
    Calculate the partial dot product using np.dot()
    Lock and update the shared output variable with the partial result
    Define a function named run_parallel_algorithm which takes num_threads as an argument
    Calculate the size of the subtasks by dividing vector_size by num_threads
    Create a shared output variable for the dot product using mp.Value()
    Create a lock for updating the shared output variable using mp.Lock()
    Start measuring time
    Create a list named threads
    Create num_threads processes and append them to the threads list
    Start each process and wait for all threads to finish
    Stop measuring time
    Calculate the execution time
    Return the execution time
    Define a function named main
    Create a range of thread counts from 1 to the number of CPUs using mp.cpu_count()
    Calculate the execution time for each number of threads using the run_parallel_algorithm function
    Plot the execution time against the number of threads using plt.plot()
    Label the x and y axis, and title the plot using plt.xlabel(), plt.ylabel(), and plt.title()
    Display the plot using plt.show()
    Find the optimal number of threads by finding the index of the minimum execution time using np.argmin(), and getting the corresponding thread count from the thread_counts list
    Print the optimal number of threads using print()
    Call the main() function if name == "main"
    Use mp.freeze_support() to protect against the possibility of the module being imported by a program that is not multiprocessing-aware.
